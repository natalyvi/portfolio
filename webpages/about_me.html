    <div class="article">
        <div class="card1">
           <p> I was born in a small city in Colombia, since I was a little kid I was interested in how the things we use in
           everyday life are made and when I grew up, I decided to study Mechanical Engineering because of the design orientation it had.</p>

            <p>When I finished all my classes I went to do an internship at an Ice Factory and I discovered my passion for
                the optimization of existing processes.</p>

            <p>After 4 years I moved to the US and worked on the service industry and as a  general manager for a couple of years,
            I learned a lot of communication skills and how to work in teams and achieve goals.</p>

            <p>I moved on with my career and worked on quality control in a car manufacturer company, that job teached me to
            spot hard to find defects and to work under deadlines.</p>

            <p>Every one of those experiences took me to the point I am right now, where I am able to use on a daily basis every lesson I learned, enjoying
            what I do.</p>
